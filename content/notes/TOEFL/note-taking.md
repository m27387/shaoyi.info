Since TOEFL is a standardized test, the time limitation is one of its critical challenges. For example, test-takers are given 15 seconds to prepare and 45 seconds to answer a preference/agree-disagree/ question in the Independent Speaking sub-section. It is considered counterintuitive, even against humanity, because the process is not how daily conversations happen.
## Basic principles
This is a memo I summarized from a [youtube video]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXAbraAOdBQ)): 
1. Do not jot down every details
   - It is not neccessary
   - lose points
   - ``(?)`` then, what are important must-haves?
2. Guess (anticipate) the questions
   - What is the [question type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI0YOyvLk50)? (Prevent from taking UNNECESSARY notes)
