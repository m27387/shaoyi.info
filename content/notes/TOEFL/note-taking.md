Since TOEFL is a standardized test, the time limitation is one of its critical challenges. For example, test-takers are given 15 seconds to prepare and 45 seconds to answer a preference/agree-disagree/ question in the Independent Speaking sub-section. It is considered counterintuitive, even against humanity, because the process is not how daily conversations happen.
## Basic principles
This is a memo I summarized from a [youtube video]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXAbraAOdBQ)): 
1. Do not jot down every details
   - Do not focus on **mpt** things -> lose points
   - It is not neccessary
   - ``(?)`` then, what are important must-haves? **check the Tip #2**
2. Guess (anticipate) the questions
   - What is the [question type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI0YOyvLk50)? (Prevent from taking UNNECESSARY notes)

3. Do not copy the speakers (**paraphrases**) \
   This is tricky because we all want to copy the original words (terms) used in the questions. However, the terminologies should be adopted into the speakers' own words.
4. Be aware of questions' self-corrections \
