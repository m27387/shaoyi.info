The shortcode replaces the base Hugo functionality in order to provide additional performance benefits.\nWhen a provided image is a page resource, it will be optimised using Hugo Pipes and scaled in order to provide images appropriate to different device resolutions. If a static asset or URL to an external image is provided, it will be included as-is without any image processing by Hugo.\nThe figure shortcode accepts six parameters:\nParameter Description src Required. The local path/filename or URL of the image. When providing a path and filename, the theme will attempt to locate the image using the following lookup order: Firstly, as a page resource bundled with the page; then an asset in the assets/ directory; then finally, a static image in the static/ directory. alt Alternative text description for the image. caption Markdown for the image caption, which will be displayed below the image. class Additional CSS classes to apply to the image. href URL that the image should be linked to. target The target attribute for the href URL. nozoom nozoom=true disables the image \u0026ldquo;zoom\u0026rdquo; functionality. This is most useful in combination with a href link. default Special parameter to revert to default Hugo figure behaviour. Simply provide default=true and then use normal Hugo shortcode syntax. Blowfish also supports automatic conversion of images included using standard Markdown syntax. Simply use the following format and the theme will handle the rest:\n![Alt text](image.jpg \u0026#34;Image caption\u0026#34;) Example:\n{{\u0026lt; figure src=\u0026#34;abstract.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Abstract purple artwork\u0026#34; caption=\u0026#34;Photo by [Jr Korpa](https://unsplash.com/@jrkorpa) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;!-- OR --\u0026gt; ![Abstract purple artwork](abstract.jpg \u0026#34;Photo by [Jr Korpa](https://unsplash.com/@jrkorpa) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\u0026#34;) Photo by Jr Korpa on Unsplash Gallery # gallery allows you to showcase multiple images at once, in a responsive manner with more varied and interesting layouts.\nIn order to add images to the gallery, use img tags for each image and add class=\u0026quot;grid-wXX\u0026quot; in order for the gallery to be able to identify the column width for each image. The widths available by default start at 10% and go all the way to 100% in 5% increments. For example, to set the width to 65%, set the class to grid-w65. Additionally, widths for 33% and 66% are also available in order to build galleries with 3 cols. You can also leverage tailwind\u0026rsquo;s responsive indicators to have a reponsive grid.\nExample 1: normal gallery\n{{\u0026lt; gallery \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/01.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/02.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/03.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/04.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/05.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/06.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/07.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; {{\u0026lt; /gallery \u0026gt;}} Example 2: responsive gallery\n{{\u0026lt; gallery \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/01.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/02.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/03.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/04.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/05.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/06.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/07.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; {{\u0026lt; /gallery \u0026gt;}} GitHub Card # github allows you to quickly link a github repository, all while showing and updating in realtime stats about it, such as the number of stars and forks it has.\nParameter Description repo [String] github repo in the format of username/repo Example 1:\n{{\u0026lt; github repo=\u0026#34;nunocoracao/blowfish\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} nunocoracao/blowfish Personal Website \u0026amp; Blog Theme for Hugo HTML 1421 398 GitLab Card # gitlab allows you to quickly link a GitLab Project (GitLab\u0026rsquo;s jargon for repo).

Another Awesome Header date - present Awesome Subheader With html code Coffee Tea Milk Shortcodes AWESOME With other shortcodes TypeIt # TypeIt is the most versatile JavaScript tool for creating typewriter effects on the planet. With a straightforward configuration, it allows you to type single or multiple strings that break lines, delete \u0026amp; replace each other, and it even handles strings that contain complex HTML.\nBlowfish implements a sub-set of TypeIt features using a shortcode. Write your text within the typeit shortcode and use the following parameters to configure the behavior you want.\nParameter Description tag [String] html tag that will be used to render the strings. classList [String] List of css classes to apply to the html element. initialString [String] Initial string that will appear written and will be replaced. speed [number] Typing speed, measured in milliseconds between each step. lifeLike [boolean] Makes the typing pace irregular, as if a real person is doing it. startDelay [number] The amount of time before the plugin begins typing after being initialized. breakLines [boolean] Whether multiple strings are printed on top of each other (true), or if they\u0026rsquo;re deleted and replaced by each other (false). waitUntilVisible [boolean] Determines if the instance will begin when loaded or only when the target element becomes visible in the viewport. The default is true loop [boolean] Whether your strings will continuously loop after completing Example 1:\n{{\u0026lt; typeit \u0026gt;}} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet {{\u0026lt; /typeit \u0026gt;}} Example 2:\n{{\u0026lt; typeit tag=h1 lifeLike=true \u0026gt;}} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. {{\u0026lt; /typeit \u0026gt;}} Example 3:\n{{\u0026lt; typeit tag=h3 speed=50 breakLines=false loop=true \u0026gt;}} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. {{\u0026lt; /typeit \u0026gt;}} Youtube Lite # A shortcut to embed youtube videos using the lite-youtube-embed library.
